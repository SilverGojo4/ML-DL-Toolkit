# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Toolkit

This repository serves as a toolkit for various machine learning and deep learning models, providing implementations and examples. It currently includes models such as Linear Regression (with Lasso and Ridge regressions), Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and a general model evaluation script. Plans for future implementations include machine learning models like CatBoost, LightGBM, and deep learning architectures like CNN2D and Vision Transformer (ViT).

## Project Structure

The toolkit is organized as follows:

#### ML-DL-TOOLKIT/
- `model_evaluation.py`: Scripts for evaluating model performance with various metrics

#### ML-DL-TOOLKIT/MachineLearning/
- `linear_regression.py`: Implementation of Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models
- `random_forest.py`: Random Forest algorithm for classification and regression tasks
- `svm.py`: Support Vector Machine model for classification and regression tasks
- `xgboost.py`: XGBoost model for classification and regression tasks

### Future plans include:

- `catboost.py`: To be Implemented - CatBoost model
- `lightgbm.py`: To be Implemented - Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model
- `cnn2d.py`: To be Implemented - 2D Convolutional Neural Networks model
- `vit.py`: To be Implemented - Vision Transformer model

## Installation Requirements

To run the scripts, you'll need the following libraries installed:
```
# Future dependencies will be updated as new models are added.
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- joblib
```
